                    <br/>
                    <p><strong>What <i>can</i> the Pontus Slackbot do exactly?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    The Pontus Slackbot is an application developed to save your Slack messages to an online external drive.
                    All you gotta do is instruct Pontus to save your message(s) and it will perform it instantly. Easy peasy!
                    Pontus can save individual as well as collective messages-as much as a whole Slack conversation!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Can Pontus be used on any platform other than Slack?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    No, Pontus works exclusively with the Slack platform. But hey, you never know how soon Pontus will 
                    decide to sweep into your next favourite application.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>What sort of conversations can Pontus be used on?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Pontus can be used on channels and direct messages.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Can users edit messages saved to Pontus?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Yes, users can edit and delete messages saved to the drive when they login to the drive, so you don't have to worry about mistakes
                    or a crowded drive.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>How much memory does the Pontus Slackbot have for a user?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Pontus allows users save as many messages as possible. There's no limit at the moment.
                    <p><strong>Can stored messages be copied to a physical external drive?</strong>
                    <br/>At the moment, Pontus cannot copy to a physical drive or be converted to a PDF or .docx format. 
                    However, our team of dedicated programmers are working hard to develop this feature, and we assure it will be available soon.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong><i>We assume your next question right now is "Why don't I just go ahead and use the Pontus Slackbot?",
                         and we'll answer that for you:</i></strong>
                         <br/>Yes, you should. Right now.
